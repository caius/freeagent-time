# FreeAgent Time

A little CLI I use for timetracking via the FreeAgent API.

- [ ] Authenticate to the FreeAgent API (& store token in macOS Keychain)
- [ ] Create new timetracking event
- [ ] Stop currently running timer
- [ ] List timetracking events from today/week
- [ ] Given an expected target, show ahead/behind budget

## Development

Go runtime required. Go modules in usage.

Please feel free to propose changes, if they are sweeping then open an issue first to see if I'll accept them. I don't want to maintain code I'm not using üòÅ
