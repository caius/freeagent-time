# FreeAgent Time

[![Project Status: Concept ‚Äì Minimal or no implementation has been done yet, or the repository is only intended to be a limited example, demo, or proof-of-concept.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/concept.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#concept)

A little CLI I use for timetracking via the FreeAgent API.

- [ ] Authenticate to the FreeAgent API (& store token in macOS Keychain)
- [ ] Create new timetracking event
- [ ] Stop currently running timer
- [ ] List timetracking events from today/week
- [ ] Given an expected target, show ahead/behind budget

## Development

Rubygem shipping a binary.

Please feel free to propose changes, if they are sweeping then open an issue first to see if I'll accept them. I don't want to maintain code I'm not using üòÅ
